# ptex-base

The bundle contains plain TeX format and documents for pTeX and e-pTeX.

## Character encoding

All the text files containing Japanese characters in ptex-texmf are
encoded in ISO-2022-JP. This is because ISO-2022-JP encoded texts
are most suitable for the traditional pTeX engine.

## License

The bundle may be distributed and/or modified under the terms of
the 3-clause BSD license (see LICENSE).
